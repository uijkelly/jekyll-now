I write code. Lots of code. In lots of languages.


### More Information

Recently embarked on a journey starting a coding club at the local middle school.

Some of the things we are using:
  - Code Academy [Python Learning](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
  - [CanaKit Raspberry Pi](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit/dp/B01C6Q2GSY/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1517506364&sr=8-2-spons&keywords=CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit%2F&psc=1)
  - [Creative Projects with Raspberry Pi](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Projects-Raspberry-Kirsten-Kearney/dp/1419725009) book
  - And corresponding [website](https://www.quartoknows.com/page/raspberry-pi)
  - A couple of Kuman kits with breadboard, wires, sensors and the like. So far, not impressed with the documentation and tutorials, but will talk about these in the projects where we use them. Any starter kit with breadboard etc would be a good choice if you want to try anything out as well.
