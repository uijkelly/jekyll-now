Going back to a command line game to talk about refactoring (but not in those words)

We will use a little [number guessing game](https://github.com/uijkelly/coding_club/blob/master/guess.py) to talk about how to tell what a program is doing, do some group coding, and make some small edits.

### In Practice

Today was pretty darn successful. I will say, in reality, keeping even four 6th graders engaged and on-task is pretty tricky. I am starting to get why drag and drop and gamification is such a thing; however, I am still committed to teaching them code with actual code.

Today was an example that it can be done! The program was written enough, but also with just enough left to figure out. We talked about breaking things, and did some more white-boarding when they had trouble thinking abstractly about numbers.

We also started out with a fun field trip to see some solar panels, wind turbines and other fun things that the science teacher and classes are working on and with. They need some more things -- some controllers and information about sensors -- and my mind is full of ideas for what we could potentially do.

### In the End
9/10 Would recommend. Also, I might want to be a science teacher? But seriously, I do want to get my hands a bit dirtier, and I'm really excited about all the prospective projects we could handle.
