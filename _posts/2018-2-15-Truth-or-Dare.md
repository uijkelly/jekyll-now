Designing an adventure game, because I'm always missing something with the RaspberryPi!

### In Practice

I pulled out the Post-its again today. To which there was a little groaning. But that feels about right. Who hasn't rolled their eyes (at least internally) when someone cracks out the Post-its at a meeting?!

I had this idea we'd do something like a _Choose Your Own Adventure_ game; it didn't quite turn out that way. Instead they immediately gravitated to a Truth or Dare type situation, which was more than fine. Perhaps harder to conceptualize as code. I added a bit of my own spin in a few spots, but most choices involved eating weird things (gum from under the table, a rhino, licking a shoe) and ended in death. But it will be a fine program when we are done.

After the choices were mapped out on the white board, we drafted some psuedocode. For the next time, I'll draft some python and leave holes for them to fill in. Much like the guessing game session, they are getting closer to getting things, but it's still tricky to keep attention.

### In the End
Still thinking about how to hook into the Net Zero Lab the science teacher is building, but there always seems to be a component that I'm missing or isn't quite right in order to make something.
