Now with less basketball, and more functions. Blinking LED Again!

I've updated the blink.py code from the previous session to add a loop and to move things into functions. We'll [use this](https://github.com/uijkelly/coding_club/blob/master/blink_loop.py) to talk about looping, and to talk about how functions can make our lives easier.


### In Practice

### In the End
