title: Blinking LED Again and maybe a sound sensor?
---

Now with less basketball, and more functions. Blinking LED Again! Trial of a sound sensor.

I've updated the blink.py code from the previous session to add a loop and to move things into functions. We'll [use this](https://github.com/uijkelly/coding_club/blob/master/blink_loop.py) to talk about looping, and to talk about how functions can make our lives easier.


### In Practice
OK, so we did the blinking light again, but my initial try at looping wasn't working. And no one was feeling particularly patient (or focused), so we left it and might revisit the newer code that was revised afterwards.

So then we turned to the sound sensors. This kit I have in particular is pretty hard to understand and untangle. There's not any documentation with the kit except for a mini-CD that I have no way of reading. The internet is failing me a little here, but I was able to find a few things, and I'm starting to understand the GPIO pins and the language of RaspberryPi diagrams. Just like before, I think showing the students that I am learning too and don't just have all the answers is important. But it was not quite successful, mostly I think because we didn't quite have the sensor wired correctly. More investigation is needed.

### In the End
This session was a bit of a bummer. There was lots of distraction and struggle. However, it wasn't without its lessons. The next session we will return to some command line games, and try to do some group programming. I need more time to get comfortable with the RaspberryPis.
