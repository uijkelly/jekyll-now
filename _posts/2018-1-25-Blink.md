Blinking LED!

We set up one RaspberryPi and did a simple project. There are even fewer this time, because of basketball again, but that's ok. It gives us time to try out some new things I have never done before.  We are using code and instructions from [quartoknows](https://www.quartoknows.com/page/raspberry-pi-blinking-led)

### In Practice

Just having two kids (and one being my daughter), I wasn't too worried about not being familiar with what I was doing. I think it can be useful to let the students know that I don't know everything, and making mistakes, or searching the internet is all a part of the process.

### In the End

This was so good, I am going to do it again with the bigger crew that I am expecting next week. Will be updating the code a little so that we can illustrate a few things like loops and functions.
