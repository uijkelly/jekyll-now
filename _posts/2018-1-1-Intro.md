title: How it all started
---

I'm a programmer and so of course I think it's super awesome and everyone should also do it, like doing it, and can have fun doing it.

My family has recently moved, and my daughter started middle school this year. The school is significantly smaller than the one she had been slated to attend at our old house, and I had a desire to jump in and start something and so I took the jump and just emailed the principal and vice principal to see if there was a desire, and what we could potentially do.

They were unsurprisingly awesome and open to whatever! :tada:

So roughly, what we settled on was that I was going to teach the kids some python. Real python. Not drag and drop, not code blocks or other app-based programming. And we would get some RaspberryPi kits and build up to using those.

## Why "Real" Code?
I have no doubts that all the drag and drop and interactive code programs that exist are really fantastic. But that's just not where my comfort-level is, and it's not what I wanted to do. I think there is real _power_ in sitting down and physically typing out a program. That the majority of these kids have already been exposed in some way to logic is definitely helpful, but I adored command line programs (Castle Adventure anyone?) as a kid, and that's where I gravitate for examples. This club is going to be me showing/teaching/helping kids after all, so it should be comfortable to me.
