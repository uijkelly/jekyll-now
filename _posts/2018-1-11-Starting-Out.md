title: Starting Out

The first session! Getting to know you. Trying out Code Academy.

Aside from my own daughter, I didn't know who any of the kids were going to be, what their interests might be, or what they have done code-wise previously. So I kept this first session loose. The plan was for me to hear a little bit about why they joined, what they've done before, and then I was going to show them IDLE and how to navigate directories by using an example Project Euler problem.

### In Practice

We got to know each other a bit. And prior to starting, I had settled on the [python interactive tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) at Code Academy as a good place for us to start. Each student at the middle school is issued a Chromebook, so I figured this would allow them to do it on their own time if they wanted.

Additionally, we meet in a lab full of iMacs. It's great. Python is already installed, IDLE is there, we have web browsers. There's a projector. Except this first time, we had no remote to turn it on! No worries, it's casual. I'm cool. Right?

Until I forgot they were 11 and started talking about modulos and fizz-buzz puzzles. Not the best example at all.

But we recovered, I abandoned that entirely, and just helped them get through some Code Academy items. We talked about integers and floats and the differences (they knew already, just in some different terms). We talked a little about the command line, but not too much.

### In the End 

It was not the worst first day, but not the best either. But I left feeling pretty ok about it.
